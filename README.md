# Toggle Block Script for Home Assistant
This Bash script allows Home Assistant users to toggle sections of a configuration file between active and inactive states by commenting or uncommenting blocks of code. It's ideal for dynamically updating configuration files like frigate.yaml based on triggers, such as the state of a group or sensor.
